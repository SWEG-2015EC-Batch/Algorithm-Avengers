Analysis:
•	Input(s): Reads File_Size_in_Bytes
•	Output(s): Time_for_Transmission
•	Operation(s): Time_for_Transmission = File_Size_in_Bytes/960
Pseudocode
•	Step 1: Start
•	Step 2: Declare a variable for the file size in bytes and the transmission speed in characters per second.
•	Step 3: Read the file size from the user.
•	Step 4: Calculate the number of characters in the file by multiplying the file size by a conversion factor (assuming 1 byte = 1 character).
•	Step 5: Calculate the time it will take to transmit the file by dividing the number of characters by the transmission speed.
•	Step 6: Convert the time to hours, minutes, and seconds for better readability.
•	Step 7: Display the time it will take to transmit the file in hours, minutes, and seconds.
•	Step 8: Stop
